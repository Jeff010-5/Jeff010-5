THis is a project from The MagPi magazine issue 117 using CDP Studio to build a Raspberry Pi / Sense Hat application to monitor Temperature, Pressure and Humidity.
As such there is no coding as it uses the inbuilt Sense Hat component from CDP Studio. It is hoped to use this as the basis for a more comprehensive weather 
station set up but its early days!
